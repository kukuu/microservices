# Microservices
Achieving Continuous Delivery with Microservices


# Problem Statement
Choosing which architecture is right for your project is a very complex task. 
Flexibility, size, time frames, diversity of the team and specific conditions of the project are 
just some of the factors that need to be considered when deciding which software architecture is the
best for your project.


# What is Microservices architecture?
In simple terms, a Microservices architecture refers to an application which is constructed from a 
number of independent services called “Microservices”.  Each microservice is a 
self-contained module that performs a discrete group of functions. 
Although the term “micro” does not mean that the modules that make up the system are necessarily small, 
just independent. In fact they each may have a website, web service, windows service and a database. 
Communication between each of these modules is achieved via web service calls and messages
 on a service bus that calls to and collects the relevant data/information from each module.
