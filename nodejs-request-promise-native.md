# Using NodeJS request-promise-native

"request-promise-native" is a Node.js library that provides a simplified and user-friendly way to make HTTP requests using the request library along with the native ES6 Promises. It combines the ease of use of the request library with the asynchronous capabilities of Promises, making it convenient for developers to work with asynchronous HTTP requests in a more readable and manageable manner.

The request-promise-native library is particularly useful when dealing with asynchronous operations, such as making API calls or fetching data from remote servers, and handling the responses in a streamlined way.

Here's a brief overview of its key features and benefits:

- Promises Integration: request-promise-native seamlessly integrates with native ES6 Promises, allowing you to work with asynchronous operations in a more organized and readable manner.

- Simplified Syntax: The library simplifies the syntax for making HTTP requests by using method chaining and straightforward options configuration.

- Error Handling: Promises in request-promise-native automatically handle errors, making it easier to manage errors and exceptions in your code.

- Asynchronous Flow Control: With Promises, you can use features like async/await to manage the asynchronous flow of your code, making it more structured and easy to understand.

Here's a basic example of how you might use request-promise-native:

```
const rp = require('request-promise-native');

async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await rp.get('https://api.example.com/data');
    console.log('Data:', response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}

fetchData();


```

In this example, the await keyword is used to wait for the HTTP request to complete, and any errors are caught and handled in the catch block.

Overall, request-promise-native simplifies working with HTTP requests in Node.js by combining the convenience of the request library with the power of Promises for asynchronous operations.
